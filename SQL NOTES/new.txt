mySQL depends on the schema based RDBMS system where the data is in the form of tables ie rows and columns

mySQL is having queries which are divided into DDL, DML, DQL, DCL+TCL.

first we need  to learn how to create a database , how to create a table with constraints and how to update the constraints by populating the data inside the table.

next we will learn how to modify the table data by update method and later on comes the select * from feature to fetch particular data.

NOW everything is done on commandline further we are going to do the same with sqlYog or workbench GUI

steps followed to create database , table and insert values inside table and show data in table.

--> create database database_name; // semicolon is must and database_name is custom
--> use database_name; // switching on to the database
--> create table table_name(table_heads, type of table_heads); //creating rows and columns for the table we need headers
--> desc table_name; // shows the table headers with constraints
-->  insert into table_name 
     values(table_data and if strings ''); // to insert data into the tables
--> select * from table_name // shows the entire table.
