mySQL depends on the schema based RDBMS system where the data is in the form of tables ie rows and columns

mySQL is having queries which are divided into DDL, DML, DQL, DCL+TCL.

first we need  to learn how to create a database , how to create a table with constraints and how to update the constraints by populating the data inside the table.

next we will learn how to modify the table data by update method and later on comes the select * from feature to fetch particular data.

NOW everything is done on commandline further we are going to do the same with sqlYog or workbench GUI

steps followed to create database , table and insert values inside table and show data in table.

--> create database database_name; // semicolon is must and database_name is custom
--> use database_name; // switching on to the database
--> create table table_name(table_heads, type of table_heads); //creating rows and columns for the table we need headers
--> desc table_name; // shows the table headers with constraints
-->  insert into table_name 
     values(table_data and if strings ''); // to insert data into the tables
--> select * from table_name // shows the entire table.

suppose if we don't wanna give a data for a particular row we shall write one more syntax like given below
--> insert into product_table(id, name, price)
    values(105, 'redmi', 6000);

here there are around 4 table headers including description and if we are not giving any description the output in the table comes as a NULL

to display only the number of columns from the existing table
--> select colname1 , colname2 FROM table_name;

to Update the table row's inner data

->update product_table
    -> set name = 'oppo'
    -> where id = 103;
// to drop the table

->drop table table_name;

Constraints in mySQL:
DEFAULT, primary key, foreign key, check, unique, not null.

all of these describes about the content while inserting into the table 
1. default presets the value , if not entered manually the default fills it up.
2. primary key is giving the non empty feature and uniqueness while we try duplication it throws error.
3. foreign key targets the data outside which is insisting in other table, and if it matches it allows to enter the data or else gives us an error.
4. check uses to check for particular condition and allow to insert in the table.
5. unique doesn't allow duplication of values but can allow null type entries.
6. if we give not null and try to insert null value this throws an error.
