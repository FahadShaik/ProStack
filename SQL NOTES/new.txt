mySQL depends on the schema based RDBMS system where the data is in the form of tables ie rows and columns

mySQL is having queries which are divided into DDL, DML, DQL, DCL+TCL.

first we need  to learn how to create a database , how to create a table with constraints and how to update the constraints by populating the data inside the table.

next we will learn how to modify the table data by update method and later on comes the select * from feature to fetch particular data.

NOW everything is done on commandline further we are going to do the same with sqlYog or workbench GUI
